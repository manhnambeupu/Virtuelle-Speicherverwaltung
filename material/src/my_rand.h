  * @brief This is the implementation of the standard Unix random number generator as described in 
  *                  https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/rng.html
  *        It is implemented to support the same random number sequence on different systms.
  *        gnu.org describes the generator aus follows: The standard Unix random number generators rand, 
  *        random and rand48 are provided as part of GSL. Although these generators are widely available 
  *        individually often they aren’t all available on the same platform. This makes it difficult to 
  *        write portable code using them and so we have included the complete set of Unix generators in 
  *        GSL for convenience. Note that these generators don’t produce high-quality randomness and aren’t 
  *        suitable for work requiring accurate statistics. However, if you won’t be measuring statistical 
  *        quantities and just want to introduce some variation into your program then these generators are 
  *        quite acceptable.
